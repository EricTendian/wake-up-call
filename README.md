Wake Up Call
============

Set up. Wake up. Get on with your day. A wake up caller built with Node.js, Twilio, and Heroku
Wake Up Call is an app created by Anwell Wang and Dylan Steele for [CodeDay Seattle](http://seattle.codeday.org). It will call a phone number repeatedly until someone picks up and then ask that person a math question to ensure that they are awake. At the moment it only works with verified phone numbers, but the app will work for any number with a full Twilio phone number.

Modules used
------------
For this app we used the Node.js modules express, querystring, and node-schedule.
